# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing issue encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes or nested layouts.  The issue results in incorrect page rendering or unexpected navigation behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to various routes to observe the unexpected behavior.

## Expected Behavior

Pages should render correctly based on the defined routes and layout structure.

## Actual Behavior

Pages are rendered incorrectly or unexpected page transitions occur.  The exact behavior varies depending on the specific route or layout configuration.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the route configuration and layout structure, potentially involving adjustments to dynamic route definitions or the use of `useSearchParams` hook for dynamic route parameters.  Refer to the solution file for an example. This fix might involve restructuring the app directory,  adjusting the way you handle params, ensuring proper usage of `Link` component for client-side navigation or using layout components to dynamically manage shared content.
